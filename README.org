* ihai - I have an idea!
** Overview
So you're hacking away, and realise that you need to refactor some code. But it's not in the path of what you're actually working on. When this happens to me, I often find myself faced with a very small decision - which drops me out of my zone:
- Do I open a browser and create a ticket, risking distractions and losing flow entirely?
- Do I add a TODO in the code, making it a tiny bit uglier?
- Do I just hope to remember that this needs to be done, knowing deep inside that I will forget?

=ihai= is a small script which helps developers note these things without losing too much flow.

** Dependencies
- bash
- =go-jira= from https://github.com/go-jira/jira.

If you're on a mac, you can install go-jira using homebrew:
#+begin_src shell
  brew install go-jira
#+end_src

** Installing
The script =install.sh= should help you get things running.

It's an interactive script, and it will ask you for the following info after you run it.
- Your Jira endpoint. It should look something like: =https://YOUR_ORG.atlassian.net=.
- Your Jira username. It should look like an email address.
- Your default Jira project. (Optional)

The script does not require escalated privileges.

** Running

*** Create a ticket
=ihai= expects the ticket summary as commandline arguments. The ticket description is expected to be entered as STDIN. Before it submits the ticket, go-jira will start your default editor so you can eyeball/edit everything. If this annoys you, you can start =ihai= with the =-n= flag.

#+begin_src 
  $ ihai This is a test ticket
  Please enter a description, and exit with ctrl-d.
  This is my ticket. Yay
>> Creating ticket: OK
>> Labelling ticket as 'ihai ': OK
>> git branch name suggestion (copied to clipboard)
   git checkout -b key-1014-this-is-a-test-ticket
#+end_src

As you can see above, the ticket is labelled with the label =ihai=, to make it easy to find. It also pastes a suggested branch name into your (mac) clipboard.

**** Adding additional labels
Running =ihai= with the =-L= option followed by one or more labels (whitespace separated) will add these new labels next to the =ihai= label.

*** List all tickets created by ihai
#+begin_src
  $ ihai -l
#+end_src
This will output all existing ihai tickets which are not Done.
