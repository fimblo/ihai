* ihai
** Overview
So you're hacking away, and realise that you need to refactor some code. But it's not in the path of what you're actually working on. When this happens to me, I often find myself faced with a very small decision - which drops me out of my zone:
- Do I open a browser and create a ticket, risking distractions and losing flow entirely?
- Do I add a TODO in the code, making it a tiny bit uglier?
- Do I just hope to remember that this needs to be done, knowing deep inside that I will forget?

=ihai= is a small script which helps developers note these things without losing too much flow.

** Dependencies
- bash
- =go-jira= from https://github.com/go-jira/jira.

If you're on a mac, you can install go-jira using homebrew:
#+begin_src shell
  brew install go-jira
#+end_src

** Installing
The script =install.sh= should help you get things running.

It's an interactive script, and it will ask you for the following info after you run it.
- Your Jira endpoint. It should look something like: =https://YOUR_ORG.atlassian.net=.
- Your Jira username. It should look like an email address.
- Your default Jira project. (Optional)

The script does not require escalated privileges.

** Running
Here are the two main supported use-cases of =ihai= as of the time of writing. Running =ihai --help= should give you the rest.

It's good to know that =ihai= will always use a special label to distinguish its tickets in Jira. By default, the label is =Idea=. So all tickets created or listed by =ihai= will use that label.

*** Create a ticket
=ihai= expects the ticket summary as commandline arguments. The ticket description is expected to be entered as STDIN.
#+begin_src 
  $ ihai This is a test ticket
  Please enter a description, and exit with ctrl-d.
  This is my ticket. Yay
  >> Creating ticket:
   OK KEY-390 https://my-org.atlassian.net/browse/KEY-390
  >> Labelling ticket as an 'Idea':
  OK KEY-390 https://my-org.atlassian.net/browse/KEY-390
#+end_src

*** List all tickets created by ihai
#+begin_src
  $ ihai -l
#+end_src
This will output all existing ihai tickets which are not Done.

** Configuring
By default, =ihai= creates tickets with the label 'Idea'. If you want to change this, export an environment variable with your desired label, like so.
#+begin_src
  $ export IHAI_LABEL=MyLabel
#+end_src
You might want to add this to your profile so that it applies in the future.
