# This bash code is intended to be sourced, not run.
#
# You might need to change some things for it to work for you. Places
# to check:
#
# - The board I work in follows the Kanban flow. This _should_ work
#   even if yours is a scrum board, but I haven't tested it.
#
# - The default ticket types. The ones I'm interested in are Task,
#   Bug, and Story, and they are set in the variable
#   GOJIRA_RUN_PREFIX. Change to fit your tickets of choice.
#
# - The default statuses. The ones I have in my Jira workflow are:
#   'Backlog', 'To do', 'In Progress', 'Review & QA', 'Done'. You can
#   see them in the shell functions prefixed with 'j' below. Change as
#   you see fit.
